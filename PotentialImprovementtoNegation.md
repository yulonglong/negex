| Add “heme-negative              `[`PSEU`]`” to negation trigger list |         |        |
| Add “negative                       `[`POST`]`” |         | in version 1.2  |
| Add “no findings to suggest             `[`PREN`]`” |         |        |
| Add “-ve for             `[`PREN`]`” |         |        |
|   Remove “evaluate for             `[`PREN`]`”, as I believe that it should be a hypothetical trigger, not a negation trigger. The annotated sentences seem to agree with me that “evaluate for” does not indicate negation.|         |not in version 1.2   |
|Add “negative deflections                 `[`PSEU`]`”. I’m just guessing at what “negative deflections” means, so someone who actually knows should take a look at this one. |         |        |
|Add “without change                        `[`PSEU`]`”|         |        |
|Add “no residua                    `[`PSEU`]`”|         |        |
|Add “positive for                   `[`CONJ`]`”|         |        |
|Changed “resolved                    `[`PREN`]`” to “resolved                 `[`POST`]`” , comment: I was unclear about the word “resolved”. Five annotated sentences indicate that a “resolved” condition is a negated one. One other sentence indicates that a “resolved” condition is an affirmed one. In my mind, “resolved” should indicate that the condition was historical, not that it is negated. So… should it be added to the historical triggers list? If so, it should be removed from the negation triggers list. On the other hand, if it is a negation trigger, then the triggers file needs to change it from a `[`PREN`]` to a `[`POST`]`. I conservatively opted to do the latter (See above). (See lines 6, 449, 637, 1111, 1112, 1442. They are marked with a ??.)|         | in version 1.2," resolved" is `[`PREN`]` and `[`POST`]`|
